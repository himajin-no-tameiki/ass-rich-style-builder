# rich-ass-style-builder

A GUI app (only for windows for now) to easily build a compex style that involves multiple layers, and to automatically apply it to any ASS files.

## TODO

- add an input for the path to mpv
- add a save/load feature for layer configuration
- add a CLI interface so that you can automate

## Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode (hot module reloading enabled)
npm run dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
npm run compile

# create build with electron-builder
npm run dist

# create unpacked build with electron-builder
npm run dist:dir
```
